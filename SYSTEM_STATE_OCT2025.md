## 📋 **Meeting Insights - Real-World Commission Structures**

### **Commission Arrangements Identified**
Based on October 2025 team meeting, the following commission structures are used:

1. **Percentage of Premium**: 10% of monthly premium
2. **Fixed PMPM**: $30 per person per month
3. **Tiered Structure**: 
   - New Business: $30/month
   - Renewal: $20/month
4. **Lump Sum + Monthly**: Year 1 lump sum, then monthly payments
5. **Clawback Scenarios**: Commission reversals for cancellations
6. **Retro Terminations**: Backdated policy cancellations affecting commissions

### **Commission Forecast Requirements**
- **Commission Arrangements**: Broker-carrier agreements need tracking
- **Enrollment Forecasting**: Policy-level commission prediction
- **Payment Schedules**: Monthly, quarterly, annual payment cycles
- **Risk Assessment**: Clawback probability analysis
